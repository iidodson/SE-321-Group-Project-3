## Creating HTML Files
Use the template.html file to start a new page. DO NOT overwrite the template.html file. Please create your own file and copy the template.html code into it.

## Creating Style Sheets
Use the default.css to create styles that you want to be applied to ALL WEBPAGES. If there is a style you need for a specific page, create a new style sheet and make sure you add you code in the media query.
```
@media (max-width: 667px) {
  /* YOUR CODE GOES HERE*/
}
```
Make sure to save all stylesheets in the css folder and don't forget to link them in your seperate html file.

## Creating Javascript Files
Add all javascript files under the js folder. Don't forget to think the script to the HTML file.
